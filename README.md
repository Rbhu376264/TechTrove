# Ozone Variability Analysis

## Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the variability of the ozone layer using Python and various data science libraries. It involves preprocessing data, building models, and conducting in-depth analysis.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Anaconda installed on your system

## Installation Steps
1. **Install Anaconda**: Download and install Anaconda from [Anaconda's official website](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
2. **Create an Environment**: `conda create --name ozone_env`
